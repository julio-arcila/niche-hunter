# Decisions (ADRs)

One paragraph each. Don't relitigate — add a new ADR that supersedes an old one.

## ADR-0001 — Python 3.12 + uv
2026-08-27. Accepted. The five prototypes are already Python, and the analysis
work ahead (embeddings, HDBSCAN, regressions) has its centre of gravity there.
`uv` for env and dependency management: fast, lockfile-based, and it manages the
interpreter itself so the pinned 3.12 does not depend on what happens to be on
the machine.

## ADR-0002 — SQLite first, Postgres behind a URL
2026-08-27. Accepted. **Supersedes the stack table in `niche-hunter-PLAN.md`,
which specified Postgres 16 from day one.** For the first weeks the schema
changes daily and there is exactly one user; SQLite with WAL handles millions of
snapshot rows and removes a moving part while the table shapes are still being
discovered. The models are SQLAlchemy and the Alembic baseline is in place from
the start, so the swap is `NH_DATABASE_URL` and nothing else — `docker-compose.yml`
is already written for it. Move when clustering starts (Phase 2) and JSONB
queries and concurrent writers begin to matter. The plan's own principle — don't
build orchestration before there is something to orchestrate — applies to the
database too.

## ADR-0003 — Provenance and append-only are enforced in code, not reviewed
2026-08-27. Accepted. `.claude/rules/data.md` rules 1, 4 and 6 are the ones whose
violation is invisible after the fact: a snapshot overwritten or a NULL written
as 0 leaves no trace and silently corrupts every downstream median and z-score.
So they are mechanical: `Collector._stamp()` injects `source`/`run_id`/`at` on
every row, the `AppendOnly` mixin plus a `before_flush` listener raises
`AppendOnlyViolation` on any snapshot mutation, and `nh.collectors.parse.*`
return `None` rather than 0. Tests in `tests/test_base_collector.py` assert each.
The cost is a little indirection in `base.py`; the benefit is that a new
collector cannot get these wrong by omission.

## ADR-0004 — One `raw_records` table, not `raw_<source>` per source
2026-08-27. Accepted. The plan called for a `raw_*` table per source. A single
table with `(source, kind, key)` and a JSON payload satisfies the actual
requirement — the raw payload is stored before normalization, so re-normalizing
history is a query rather than a re-fetch — with far less schema churn while
sources are still being added. Revisit if a single source's payloads grow large
enough to want their own partitioning.

## ADR-0005 — Prototypes are frozen in `legacy/`, ported one at a time
2026-08-27. Accepted. The five `niche_hunter_*.py` scripts moved to `legacy/`
unchanged, are excluded from ruff, and are blocked from edits in
`.claude/settings.json`. They are the reference for what the domain logic is
supposed to do; a port that changes behaviour and breaks something should be
diffable against a fixed original. Each is deleted only once its collector is
ported, tested against a recorded fixture, and running in a nightly.

## ADR-0006 — RSS is the first collector to build
2026-08-27. Accepted; **ordering claim superseded by ADR-0007**. `youtube_rss` was the first collector to port because it is the only
collector whose output cannot be reconstructed later: view velocity is a
difference between observations, and no source serves historical view counts.
Everything else — search results, Trends shapes, keyword volumes — can be
re-fetched at close to its present value. RSS also costs zero quota, so running
it first never competes with anything.

## ADR-0007 — Nightly run order is discovery before RSS
2026-08-27. Accepted. **Supersedes the ordering claim in ADR-0006**; that ADR's
reasoning about implementation priority stands unchanged. `REGISTRY` order *is*
nightly run order, and ADR-0006 conflated the two. Only `youtube_api` can produce
a channel list, so RSS-first makes day 1 a guaranteed no-op — and on every later
night it delays a freshly discovered channel's first velocity reading by 24 hours,
permanently, for each new channel. The irreplaceability argument in ADR-0006 in
fact argues *for* API-first: velocity is a difference between observations, so the
earlier the first observation, the sooner velocity exists at all. The apparent
benefit of RSS-first — "run the precious thing before anything can break" — is
already provided by `run_nightly()`, which catches per-collector failures and
continues; a failed `youtube_api` does not stop `youtube_rss`. There is no write
conflict either: `video_snapshots` is unique per `(video, day, source)`, so both
collectors snapshot the same video on the same day without colliding.

## ADR-0008 — One snapshot per entity per day per source
2026-08-27. Accepted. `uq_video_snapshots_day (video_id, observed_date, source)`
means the first reading of a day wins and later ones are silently dropped by
`insert_ignore`. That is correct and deliberate for a daily job: re-running a day
is a safe no-op. The consequence to remember is that the future `hourly_hot` job
**cannot** write here — a second same-day poll would vanish. Intraday velocity
needs either a snapshot table keyed to the minute or an extended unique key.
Recorded now so nobody "fixes" the drop by making snapshots updatable, which
would violate data rule 4 and destroy the series.

## ADR-0009 — Collector batches commit as they go
2026-08-27. Accepted. `Collector.run()` originally wrapped a whole run in one
transaction and rolled it back on any failure, so a collector dying at feed 700 of
800 discarded all 700. For a pipeline whose entire premise is that snapshots
cannot be re-fetched tomorrow, that traded a partial success for a total loss.
`_flush()` now commits, and the rollback on failure drops only the batch in
flight. The cost is that a failed run leaves partial data — which is the right
trade here, and is visible in `job_runs` (`status='failed'` alongside non-zero
`snapshots_written`) rather than hidden.

## ADR-0010 — Bulk raw payloads are compressed and time-bounded
2026-08-27. Accepted. **Refines ADR-0004**, which is still right about one
`raw_records` table but was sized for JSON payloads of a few KB. Measured against
live data: YouTube's Atom feeds return **no cache validators** — no ETag, no
Last-Modified — so a conditional GET can never produce a 304 and every nightly
poll stores the full ~64 KB of XML per channel, near-identical to the night
before. Three runs produced 95.8 MB and a 127 MB database, tracking toward ~21 GB
a year and rising with the channel count. Two changes, because each alone still
grows without limit: payloads over 4 KB are gzipped into `payload_gz` with a
`codec` column saying which form is stored (95.8 MB → 18.9 MB, and the whole
database 127 MB → 49 MB), and `feed` payloads older than
`NH_RAW_RETENTION_DAYS` (14) are pruned nightly. The threshold is on **size, not
kind**, so nothing needs special-casing as a new source arrives; small payloads
stay readable JSON and remain queryable with JSON operators.

The retention prune is the only deliberate deletion in the codebase. It touches
`raw_records` and nothing else: `nh.db.retention.prune_raw_records` is hard-coded
to that model. Snapshots are never pruned — they are the unbackfillable asset and
the reason the pipeline exists, while raw payloads are a replay convenience whose
value decays. Note the prune uses a Core DELETE, which the `AppendOnly` ORM guard
in `nh.db.session` does not see; that guard prevents *accidental* mutation, and
the narrowness of this function is what prevents deliberate misuse.

The conditional-GET machinery in `youtube_rss` is kept despite being inert. It is
tested, costs nothing, and YouTube may add validators later. `requests` already
negotiates gzip on the wire (~7 MB a night for 955 feeds), so transfer was never
the problem — storage was.

## ADR-0011 — The YouTube quota ledger is per day, not per run
2026-08-27. Accepted. `QuotaLedger` was constructed fresh on every collector run
with the full 9,500-unit budget, but YouTube's quota is allocated **per day** and
tracked server-side across every call the key makes. A second run in the same day
— a manual retry, a re-run after a failure, two cron fires — therefore believed it
had a full budget, spent past the real ceiling, and got throttled. Found live: after
9,624 units of verification runs, the next invocation failed with `retries exhausted
for search` rather than stopping cleanly, because a 429 storm looks nothing like a
quota message. `YouTubeApiCollector` now sums `job_runs.quota_used` for this source
since **midnight America/Los_Angeles** — neither UTC nor local midnight — and starts
the ledger with what is left.

Two supporting changes. A `403 quotaExceeded` from Google is recognised and raises
`QuotaExhausted` immediately instead of being retried into an unrecognisable
"retries exhausted"; and `QuotaLedger.exhaust()` marks the budget spent without
charging anything, so once the upstream ceiling is hit every remaining query in the
run short-circuits rather than asking and being refused again. Hitting either
ceiling is a *degraded* run, not a failed one: what was collected before the stop is
kept, and `job_runs.quota_used` plus the `nh status --check` quota warning make the
degradation visible.
